Let's clearly break down each step, specifying exactly **what to do**, **where to do it**, and in what sequence, keeping in mind that **MCP here means Model Context Protocol**:

---

## üî∑ Step 1: Understand What We're Doing

* You're creating a **Docker container** (an isolated environment) that can run **bash commands safely**.
* You want to integrate this container with MCP (**Model Context Protocol**), presumably to allow a model (e.g., an LLM) to execute bash commands within this environment securely.

**Clarifying MCP (Model Context Protocol):**
MCP generally refers to a protocol or interface used by LLMs or AI agents to interact with external tools. Usually, MCP requires that you expose some endpoint (such as a REST API) for the LLM to send commands or data.

Since MCP isn't a standard Docker feature, you'll typically:

* Create a container environment.
* Set up a server (often HTTP-based) inside it.
* Connect your LLM/MCP controller to this server to issue commands.

---

## üî∑ Step 2: Prepare Your Computer (Prerequisites)

Do this **on your local machine** (laptop/desktop/server):

* **Install Docker**:
  If you haven't yet, install Docker from here:
  üëâ [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

* Ensure Docker is running:

  ```bash
  docker --version
  ```

---

## üî∑ Step 3: Create a New Directory

Do this on your computer's terminal:

* Create a new folder for your Docker setup:

```bash
mkdir bash-mcp-sandbox
cd bash-mcp-sandbox
```

---

## üî∑ Step 4: Create the Dockerfile

Inside your new `bash-mcp-sandbox` folder, create a file named `Dockerfile`.

* You can use your favorite editor (e.g., VSCode, Sublime, nano, vim).

**For simplicity**, here's the complete Dockerfile with a minimal HTTP API using Python (to execute bash commands securely and respond via HTTP):

### üìù **Dockerfile**:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Install bash and Python dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    bash \
    python3 \
    python3-pip \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install FastAPI and uvicorn for HTTP API
RUN pip3 install fastapi uvicorn

# Create working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy API script (we'll create this next)
COPY api.py /app/api.py

# Expose port 8000 for MCP connection
EXPOSE 8000

# Start the API server
CMD ["uvicorn", "api:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

---

## üî∑ Step 5: Create the API file (`api.py`)

Still inside your `bash-mcp-sandbox` folder, create another file named `api.py`:

### üìù **api.py**:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import subprocess

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def root():
    return {"status": "sandbox ready"}

@app.post("/run")
def run_bash(command: str):
    try:
        # Run the command securely and return the output
        output = subprocess.check_output(command, shell=True, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, timeout=10, executable="/bin/bash")
        return {"output": output.decode()}
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return {"error": e.output.decode()}
    except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
        return {"error": "command timeout"}
```

**What this does**:

* Receives bash commands via HTTP POST.
* Executes them safely inside the Docker container.
* Returns the output or error via JSON.

---

## üî∑ Step 6: Build Your Docker Image

Still inside your terminal, in the same `bash-mcp-sandbox` folder, run:

```bash
docker build -t bash-mcp-sandbox .
```

* This command creates a Docker image named `bash-mcp-sandbox`.

---

## üî∑ Step 7: Run Your Docker Container

Now, run the container using:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name my-bash-mcp bash-mcp-sandbox
```

* **`-d`**: Runs container in the background.
* **`-p 8000:8000`**: Maps container's port 8000 to your machine's port 8000.
* **`--name my-bash-mcp`**: Gives your container a convenient name.

---

## üî∑ Step 8: Connect MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Now your container environment is running at:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

* MCP (Model Context Protocol) can now issue commands via HTTP.

**How MCP will connect:**

* Check if sandbox is ready:

  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:8000
  ```

  You'll get:

  ```json
  {"status":"sandbox ready"}
  ```

* Run a bash command via MCP (example):

  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/run?command=ls"
  ```

  You'll get back something like:

  ```json
  {"output":"api.py\n"}
  ```

Your MCP integration simply needs to send an HTTP request to this server.

---

## üî∑ Step 9: Stop and Cleanup (When Done)

To stop the running container later:

```bash
docker stop my-bash-mcp
docker rm my-bash-mcp
```

* Stops and removes your container safely.

---

## ‚úÖ **Complete Flow (Summary)**:

| **Step** | **Action**                         | **Where**            |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1        | Install Docker                     | Your machine         |
| 2        | Create Folder (`bash-mcp-sandbox`) | Terminal             |
| 3        | Create Dockerfile (`Dockerfile`)   | Folder               |
| 4        | Create API file (`api.py`)         | Folder               |
| 5        | Build Docker Image                 | Terminal             |
| 6        | Run Docker Container               | Terminal             |
| 7        | Connect MCP via HTTP               | MCP Client (LLM/API) |
| 8        | Stop/Remove Container              | Terminal             |

---

## üéØ **Final Result:**

* You now have a **sandboxed Docker environment**.
* MCP (Model Context Protocol) can execute Bash commands safely via HTTP API.

That's exactly how you set up this environment clearly and sequentially!
